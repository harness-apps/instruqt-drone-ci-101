title: Getting started with Drone CI
teaser: Getting started with Continuous Integration with Drone CI
description: |-
  Despite the broad adoption of Cloud Native architectures, many companies wonder why they havenâ€™t increased their developer productivity and software delivery velocity. One of the reasons is their adherence to traditional ways of building and deploying applications.

  Though 10 years old, Drone --  a cloud native self-service Continuous Integration platform --   offers a mature, Kubernetes based CI system harnessing the scaling and fault tolerance characteristics of Cloud Native architectures. Drone harnesses the power of containers and helps in  building your applications for Cloud at the same time being Simple, Declarative and Decoupled.

  In this workshop, you will learn,

  - Understanding the basics of Drone CI, writing your first pipeline
  - Using Drone CLI, running Drone CI on your laptops
  - Install and use Drone CI Extension for Docker Desktop
  - How to use secrets, environment variables with Drone CI Pipelines
  - Define multi stage Drone CI pipelines
  - Deploy the built container image to Kubernetes Cluster using Harness CD (Free Tier)
